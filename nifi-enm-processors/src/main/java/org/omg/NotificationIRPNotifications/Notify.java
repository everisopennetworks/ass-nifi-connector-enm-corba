Notification IRP IS defines 6 attributes for the notification header.  
They are: objectClass, objectInstance, notificationId, eventTime, 
systemDN and notificationType.  

The first 2 attributes are mapped into 1 name-value pair.  The name of 
the mapped IDL construct is MANAGED_OBJECT_INSTANCE.  The const
string of this mapped IDL construct is defined here.    

The notificationId, eventTime and systemDN are respectively mapped 
into 3 name-value pairs.  The const string(s) of these 3 mapped IDL 
constructs are defined here.

The notificationType is not mapped into any name-value pair 
but is mapped into the type_name position-dependent 
field of the CORBA structured-event.  There is no need for a const string 
definition for it.
