   This block identifies the alarm types specified for this IRP version.

   types of the same name.
   Their encodings for this version of Alarm IRP are defined here.  Other IRP
   documents, or other versions of Alarm IRP, shall identify their own
   alarm types for their use.  They shall define their encodings
   as well.  Values defined here are unique among themselves.
